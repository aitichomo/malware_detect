# malware_detect

machine learning model to detect malicious files based on their content, particularly strings extracted from binary files,
uses a Random Forest Classifier to classify files as malicious or benign based on the content of printable ASCII strings 
extracted from binary files. The code provides functions to extract features from files, train the detector, perform cross-validation, 
and scan individual files. It utilizes scikit-learn for machine learning and argparse for command-line argument parsing. To use the code, 
specify training data paths, files to scan, or enable cross-validation via command-line arguments.
